                <h2 class =><u>Summary</u></h2>
                <p>My name is Amar Shah, and over the course of my life I have developed a variety of hobbies. Some of them consist of <b>creating websites, learning about the finance/investing world, playing competitve basketball, and involing myself with dentistry.</b> Specifically, the websites I create are based on Html and CSS code. I began this ever since the summer of 2020 and have created 2 websites so far, and I am on pace to have one more finished by the end of 2021. Next, I also decided to start learning about investing and the importance of saving money. I strongly believe that learning the functions and terms of finance can play an very essential role-through adulthood. A final intrest of mine is dentistry, a potential career path I could possibly see getting into. I find it very facisnating how dentists prove their heroic abilites in saving people's teeth. Everyday, young kids and adults deal with cavities and toot aches, but as a dentist I would view myself as their savior and the protector of a smile. I had started this journey of learning differnt aspects of life, as a way to dieversify knowledge in multiple areas!</p>

                <h2><u>Websites</u></h2>
                <p>I find website development very calming and or peaceful! Whenever I am stressed or need to take a break from something, I always rely on Html programmming to help me relax. In terms of learning Html and CSS, I had taken a few courses every once and while, but the majority of my work was self-teaching. I personally, had always been so enlightened when people created anything software or technology related. As a result, I have followed that path, in the hopes to make others also astonished with my creations. </p>

                <h2><u>Dentistry</u></h2>
                <p>To Me, Dentistry is a very underappreicated field. I feel as if Dentists, are indeed doctors because at the end of the day they are still saving people, but from diseases that occur in the mouth like gingivitis, plaque, gum disease, etc. I began to show passion for this field ever since my dentist helped scrape the plaque off my teeth and fill in cavities as a way to save my teeth. </p>
